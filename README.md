# What is java ?? ðŸ¤”â˜•
- Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java is a highly popular, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), 
  meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
- Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
