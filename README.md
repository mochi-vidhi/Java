# Welcome to java Tutorial ☕

```java
class Hello{
public static void main(){
  System.out.println("Welcome to java Tutorial!!");
}
}
```
### What is java ?? 🤔☕
- Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java is a highly popular, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), 
  meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
- Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
### Why java is so famous??? 😎☕
- If you see the programming index the top five programming language you will always find java there may be at the first position or 4th position.
- [Top programming Languages](https://www.statista.com/chart/16567/popular-programming-languages/).
- java has multiple features which helps it to be used in the Enterprise market.
### Uses of java  😊☕
```java
- Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.🖥️
- Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.🌐
- Enterprise Applications such as banking applications. 🏦
- Mobile 📱
- Embedded System
- Smart Card 🏧
- Robotics 🤖
- Games, etc. 🎮
```

### c++ 🆚 java
| Topic                | C++                                        | Java                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Memory Management    | Use of pointers, structures, union         | No use of pointers. Supports references, thread and interfaces. |
| Libraries            | Comparatively available with low-level functionalities | Wide range of classes for various high-level services |
| Multiple Inheritance | Provide both single and multiple inheritance. | Multiple inheritances is partially done through interfaces |
| Operator Overloading | Supports operator overloading              | It doesn’t support this feature            |
| Program Handling     | Functions and variables can reside outside classes. | Functions and variables reside only in classes, packages are used. |
| Portability          | Platform dependent, must be recompiled for different platform | Platform independent, byte code generated works on every OS. |
| Thread Support       | No built-in support for threads, depends on libraries. | It has built-in thread support.            |
### java ⚔️ Python
| Topic                | Java                                        | Python                                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Compilation process | Both compiled and interpreted. Compiled into bytecode, then interpreted. | Interpreted language, code is executed directly. |
| Code Length          | Longer lines of code compared to Python.    | 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. |
| Syntax Complexity    | Block defined by curly braces, end statements by semicolons. | No need for semicolons or curly braces, uses indentation. |
| Ease of Typing       | Strongly typed, requires defining exact datatypes. | Dynamically typed, no need to define exact datatypes. |
| Speed of Execution   | Faster execution speed compared to Python.  | Expected to run slower than Java programs.   |
| Multiple Inheritance | Partially done through interfaces.           | Limited support, single inheritance preferred. |
