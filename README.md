### What is java ?? 🤔☕
- Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java is a highly popular, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), 
  meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
- Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
### Why java is so famous??? 😎☕
- If you see the programming index the top five programming language you will always find java there may be at the first position or 4th position.

### c++ 🆚 c++
| Topic                | C++                                        | Java                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Memory Management    | Use of pointers, structures, union         | No use of pointers. Supports references, thread and interfaces. |
| Libraries            | Comparatively available with low-level functionalities | Wide range of classes for various high-level services |
| Multiple Inheritance | Provide both single and multiple inheritance. | Multiple inheritances is partially done through interfaces |
| Operator Overloading | Supports operator overloading              | It doesn’t support this feature            |
| Program Handling     | Functions and variables can reside outside classes. | Functions and variables reside only in classes, packages are used. |
| Portability          | Platform dependent, must be recompiled for different platform | Platform independent, byte code generated works on every OS. |
| Thread Support       | No built-in support for threads, depends on libraries. | It has built-in thread support.            |
